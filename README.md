# 2D Game Project

A 2D game under development, built with best practices using **Singleton** and **Observer** design patterns for efficient and scalable game architecture.

## Overview
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures single instances of critical game components (e.g., GameManager, AudioManager) for centralized control.
- **Observer Pattern**: Facilitates event-driven communication between game objects, enabling dynamic updates (e.g., UI updates, game state changes).
- Focus on clean code, modularity, and maintainability.

## Status
- Work in progress. Core systems and patterns are being implemented.
